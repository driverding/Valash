# Valash

WIP. A control panel for Mihomo written in Vala.

The following instructions are also drafts. Valash is currently unusable.

## Recommended Way of Using

1. Install clash-meta kernel.

```bash
# Fedora:
sudo dnf install clash-meta
```

2. Enable clash-meta as a system service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable clash-meta
sudo systemctl start clash-meta
```

3. Modify your config.yaml

```yaml
# 
```

## Notice

1. To use provider healthcheck, provider healthcheck should be enabled in config.yaml
2.
